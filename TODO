python_ldap
===========

- LDAP types -> python types: currently everything returned as strings, need:
  newbie: boolean
  yearsPaid, id, uidNumber, gidNumber: int

====
LDAP
====

- password crypt: has to be DES until Solaris supports better methods
  crypted password gets sent by pam to ldap when checking authentication
  anyone can directly connect to ldap to try for correct passwords with
  no delay involved for incorrect passwords. this should be logged..

- capitalise:
  altmail -> altMail
  updateby -> updatedBy
  createdby -> createdBy

- add 'ldap' as a reserved type, any other ldap 'keywords' ?

- reserved & system usertypes (i.e. objectClass) no longer used in accounts
  tree ?

- reserved description should be compulsory

- birthday: lose the time, not needed
  created & updated: drop the splitsecond precision, make sure timezone is set
  in all values, i.e. +00 or +01

- home directories not consistent! also, vhosts should be in /webtree/vhosts ?

for dn,attr in ldp.search_s('ou=accounts,o=redbrick',ldap.SCOPE_ONELEVEL, 'objectClass=posixaccount', ('uid','homeDirectory', 'objectClass')):
 if attr['homeDirectory'][0] != acc.gen_homedir(attr['uid'][0], attr['objectClass'][0]):
  print attr['uid'][0]

Python

- python % format printing of values as a boolean e.g.
  print '%b %b' % (1,0) -> "true false"
  coming in 2.3 ?

- disable readline file completion

=======
General
=======

- mailman: possible to rename user on a list ? i.e. to preserve subscription
  information

- remove all rename/convert symlinks and stop using them ?

- does quorum include cmte?

- Club/Socs/Projects to be subject to years_paid (but don't actually pay).
  Helps keep track of them. Or don't bother with payment info, have custom
  command to mail & disable these accounts at start of every year?

- make rrs work on all browsers
